* sheet extension (from 0 - close haul to 1 - run) - fed to sheet actuator

config (pubs)
* polar - sailing performance for different headings relative to wind
   - modelled as 16 segments in the clockwise 180 degree region (assumes mirrored performance)
   - each segment is 180/16 degree = 11.25 degree arc, centre of segment should be considered the target heading to achieve associated performance
   - performance stored as a single uint8_t value = 0..255
